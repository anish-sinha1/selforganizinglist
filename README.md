# Self-Organizing Lists

This repository contains three different implementations for self organizing lists:

1. move-to-front (MTF)
2. transpose
3. count

Of course there are others, but to be honest they're all pretty irrelevant. Skip lists or red-black trees are generally
superior, but such is life. Sometimes another data structure just eats your lunch and that's the case for these sad
sacks here.
